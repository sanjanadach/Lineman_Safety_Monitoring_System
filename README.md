# Lineman_Safety_Monitoring_System

A real-time embedded safety solution to protect electrical linemen from accidental high-voltage exposure.

## üîß Built With
- Arduino UNO
- Voltage Detection Sensors
- GSM Module (SIM800L/SIM900)
- Embedded C
- Buzzer & LED Modules

## üìù Project Description

The **Lineman Safety Monitoring System** enhances safety for electrical workers by detecting the presence of voltage on electric lines and warning the lineman using **auditory (buzzer)** and **visual (LED)** signals. In critical conditions, it can optionally **send SMS alerts** via a **GSM module** to notify emergency contacts or supervisors.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

- üîã **Live Wire Detection**  
  Uses voltage sensors to identify the presence of high voltage before any physical contact.

- üö® **Emergency Alert System**  
  In unsafe conditions, a buzzer activates and optionally an **SMS is sent** using the GSM module.

- üì≥ **Real-Time Alerts**  
  Immediate auditory and visual feedback helps the lineman make quick decisions.

- üîí **Safety First Approach**  
  Prevents workers from accessing live wires until confirmed safe.

- üì≤ **Optional GSM Integration**  
  Sends automatic alerts to supervisors in case of voltage exposure.

- üß† **Arduino-Based Embedded Logic**  
  Simple and effective C code on Arduino to process sensor data and control output devices.

## üìÇ Example Use Case

> A lineman connects the system to a power line before maintenance. The voltage sensor detects a high voltage.  
> üî¥ Red LED and buzzer are triggered.  
> ‚úÖ Once power is shut off, the green LED turns on to indicate safety.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If voltage returns suddenly, an SMS alert is automatically sent via GSM.
